This is a test file about artificial intelligence and machine learning.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing how we approach problem-solving across various industries. Machine learning algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data to identify patterns and make predictions.

Key AI concepts:
- Neural networks and deep learning
- Natural language processing (NLP)
- Computer vision and image recognition
- Reinforcement learning and decision making

Popular AI frameworks include TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn. These tools enable developers to build sophisticated models for classification, regression, and clustering tasks.

AI applications span healthcare diagnostics, autonomous vehicles, recommendation systems, and fraud detection. The field continues to evolve rapidly with advances in transformer architectures and large language models.
