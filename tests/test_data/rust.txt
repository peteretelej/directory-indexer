This file contains information about rust programming language.

Rust is a systems programming language focused on safety, speed, and concurrency. It prevents common programming errors like null pointer dereferences and buffer overflows through its ownership system.

Key Rust features:
- Memory safety without garbage collection
- Zero-cost abstractions
- Pattern matching with match expressions
- Traits for code reusability
- Cargo package manager and build system

Rust excels in systems programming, web backends, blockchain development, and embedded systems. The language enforces memory safety at compile time, eliminating many runtime errors.

Popular Rust crates include serde for serialization, tokio for async programming, and actix-web for web development. The Rust community values performance, reliability, and developer ergonomics.
