# Troubleshooting Guide

Common issues and solutions for system problems.

## Database Connection Issues

If you encounter database timeout errors:

1. Check network connectivity
2. Verify database credentials
3. Review connection pool settings
4. Monitor database server load

## Memory Problems

Out of memory errors can be caused by:
- Large dataset processing
- Memory leaks in application code
- Insufficient heap size configuration

### Solutions:
- Increase JVM heap size: `-Xmx4g`
- Review code for memory leaks
- Implement data pagination
- Add monitoring and alerting

## Performance Issues

Slow response times may indicate:
- Database query optimization needed
- Cache configuration problems
- Network latency issues
- Resource contention

Use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks.
